## Description

_This webpage is a responsive mockup of Nike's homepage, [https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/](https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/). The website was designed with sass, Flexbox and media queries, allowing a smooth transition from desktop view to mobile view. Note that Nike's home page did not have a responsive design for mobile, thus the mockup was based on standard mobile design approaches._

_Here are some screen shots of the website and mockup comparisons:_
